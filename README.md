# Fashion-AI-segmentation
A novel approach on using the blend of image-processing technique and deep learning algorithm to segment any fashion and e-commerce retail images.
The code can be used for any industry on any images and the core algortithm is 'grab-cut algorithm" with the blend of Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks. The Repo is designed in a preview way and its limited for fashion Images with auto-segmenting Top-wear clothes(Example: Tshirt, shirts) and Full-body clothes(salwar,gowns, shirt-pants-shoes)
