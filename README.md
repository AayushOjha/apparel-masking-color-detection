# Fashion-AI-segmentation
*A New Approach by using the Blend of Image-Processing Technique and Deep-Learning Algorithm to Segment any Fashion and e-commerce Retail Images*.
The code can be used for any industry on any images and the core algortithm is 'grab-cut algorithm" with the blend of Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks. The Repo is designed in a preview way and its limited for fashion Images with auto-segmenting Top-wear clothes(Example: Tshirt, shirts) and Full-body clothes(salwar,gowns, shirt-pants-shoes)*

# Demo
#### Note: Demo Annotation shouldn't be replaced, adding new will not enable the code adaptation to new classes of images.(*The demo phase classes : Fashion full-body, Top-wear*)

1.*clone* the Repo to your local pc ensuring that all the package requirements satisfied.<enter>
  
2.Run the code from the terminal **python fashion.py image1.jpg /Users/demo/** <enter>
  
3.argument1 -- *image_name -- image1.jpg*, argument2 -- *save_directory -- /Users/demo/*

4.Visualize the results in your save_directory.
