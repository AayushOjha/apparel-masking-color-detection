# Fashion-AI-segmentation
*A New Approach by using the Blend of Image-Processing Technique and Deep-Learning Algorithm to Segment any Fashion and e-commerce Retail Images.
The code can be used for any industry on any images and the core algortithm is 'grab-cut algorithm" with the blend of Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks. The Repo is designed in a preview way and its limited for fashion Images with auto-segmenting Top-wear clothes(Example: Tshirt, shirts) and Full-body clothes(salwar,gowns, shirt-pants-shoes)*
